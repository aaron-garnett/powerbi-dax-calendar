DAX statement that generates a calendar table for use in Power BI or other SSAS oriented data model
BC refers to "Broadcast Calendar" which is a weekly calendar scheme used in the television and radio broadcast industry for advertising and ratings, following these rules:
- Each week begins on Monday and ends on Sunday
- Each week belongs to a month which is based on the calendar month in which the Sunday of the week falls. A broadcast month consists of either four or five weeks.
- Each week belongs to a year which is baed on the calendar year in which the Sunday of the week falls. A broadcast year consists of either 52 or 53 weeks.
- NOTE: The week-based broadcast calendar is not the same as the week-based ISO calendar defined by ISO 8601 and used in many other industries
